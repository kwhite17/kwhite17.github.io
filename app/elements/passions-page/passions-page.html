        <p>323 is a Christian community outreach organization based out of Highland Park, Michigan that provides a space for kids K-12 to hang out, eat pizza, and hear God's Word once a week. It's been an incredible experience hanging out with kids and watching
          them grow as they hear lessons from the Bible.</p>
