      <span>About Me</span>
      <img src="/images/masquerade.jpg" alt="Masquerade Ball" width="100%"/>
      <p>The nickname Katana comes from my days of perpetual grinding on the MMO
        MapleStory. But you can call me: K.Dub, K.Dubs, Kev and names I'm forgetting!</p>
      <p>Resident quirky nerd at your service! Hailing from Detroit, MI, I'm currently
      working as a software developer for General Motors for the OnStar platform.
      I had the fortune of spending four fantastic years in the Boston area attending
      MIT. In my free time, I enjoy watching and playing sports, watching anime, coding,
      and spending some time in the Bible. My musical tastes primarily center around hip hop,
      R&B, metal, and progressive rock (my parents find this puzzling too).</p>
