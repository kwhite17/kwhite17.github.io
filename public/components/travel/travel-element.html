      <p> As a graduation present to myself, I decided to take a trip to Japan for
        two weeks. It was an absolutely amazing trip. I primarily spent time
        in Tokyo and Kyoto. However, I did spend a day in Nara to visit the
        Todaiji Temple (and two others whose names I forgot).</p>
      <p> Kyoto was amazing. I think in my limited travel experiences it is
        safe to say that I've never been to a city quite like Kyoto. The blend
        of temples, shrines, and modern buildings created an experience that I
        believe I'll be extremely challenged to find for a long time. One
        of my favorite discoveries was thte Maimai Cafe. It was a struggle
        remebering how to speak Japanese at an all Japanese cafe, but because
        of my perseverance, I learned about this delicius Japanese dish called
        sukiyaki. The custome takes raw beef and barbecues in a marinade with
        noodles and vegetables for a delicious stew-like experience. You can
        also dip your food in raw egg for additional flavor.</p>
      <p>Tokyo was also fantastic. It is unfathomable to think about how modern
        that prefecture looks in comparison to the other places I've visited,
        including a thriving Boston. Some of the highlights there were visiting
        the onsen and visiting Tokyo proper, which contains both the imperial
        palace and the diet building, encompassed in some of the shiniest
        skyscrapers I've seen in my life. It was so breathtaking. There's so
        much more of Japan I could talk about including the chaos at the
        Hachijo Crossing (this name could be wrong) at Shibuya, anime nirvana
        at Akihabara, and the bullet train experience, but you should just ask
        me if you know me.</p>
      <p>One final point, please stop by Cafe Byron Bay. This is my favorite
        bar in Japan. It's a cafe where local patrons come to speak English
        with tourists or foreigners, giving you a great opportunity to learn
        a lot about Japanese culture from the people who live there. The
        bartender/owner is really amazing and has really created an awesome
        experience.</p>

      <span>Paris and England 2010</span>
      <p>I went to England and Paris over ten days with my mom and my best
        friends, mom, grandmother, and brother. It was a really cool experience
        that I wouldn't trade again for anything. In England, we had the
        opportunity to visit cool places such as Stonehenge, the Roman Baths at
        Bath, Buckingham Palace, and Westminster Abbey. This was a cool
        experience despite having to temporarily evacuate the hotel after
        arriving due to a bomb threat (!!!).</p>
      <p>In Paris, we got to visit historical sites such as the Louvre, the
        Eiffel Tower, and the Church of Notre Dame. In addition, we had the
        opportunity to visit the Palace at Versailles, which is by far the
        most beautiful building I have seen to this day. It is absolutely
        incredible. Our tour of the palace had us visit 20 rooms, or one
        percent of the entire palace, not including the gardens.
        As my friend said after an half hour of touring "No wonder the
        French rebelled."</p>
