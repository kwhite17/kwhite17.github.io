				<h2>Japan (June 2014)</h2>
				<p>As a graduation present to myself, I decided to take a trip to Japan for
					two weeks. It was an absolutely amazing trip. I primarily spent time
					in Tokyo and Kyoto. However, I did spend a day in Nara to visit the
					Todaiji Temple (and two others who's names I forgot).</p>
				<p> Kyoto was amazing. I think in my limited travel experiences it is
					safe to say that I've never been to a city quite like Kyoto. The blend
					of temples, shrines, and modern buildings created an experience that I
					believe I'll be extremely challenged to find for a long time. One
					of my favorite discoveries was thte Maimai Cafe. It was a struggle
					remebering how to speak Japanese at an all Japanese cafe, but because
					of my perseverance, I learned about this delicius Japanese dish called
					sukiyaki. The custome takes raw beef and barbecues in a marinade with
					noodles and vegetables for a delicious stew-like experience. You can
					also dip your food in raw egg for additional flavor.</p>
				<p>Tokyo was also fantastic. It is unfathomable to think about how modern
					that prefecture looks in comparison to the other places I've visited,
					including a thriving Boston. Some of the highlights there were visiting
					the onsen and visiting Tokyo proper, which contains both the imperial
					palace and the diet building, encompassed in some of the shiniest
					skyscrapers I've seen in my life. It was so breathtaking. There's so
					much more of Japan I could talk about including the chaos at the
					Hachijo Crossing (this name could be wrong) at Shibuya, anime nirvana
					at Akihabara, and the bullet train experience, but you should just ask
					me if you know me.</p>
				<p> One final point, please stop by Cafe Byron Bay. This is my favorite
					bar in Japan. It's a cafe where local patrons come to speak English
					with tourists or foreigners, giving you a great opportunity to learn
					a lot about Japanese culture from the people who live there. The
					bartender/owner is really amazing and has really created an awesome
					experience. </p>

					<h2>England/Paris (July 2010)</h2>
					<p>I went to England and Paris over ten days with my mom and my best
					friends, mom, grandmother, and brother. It was a really cool experience
					that I wouldn't trade again for anything. In England, we had the
					opporutnity to visit cool places such as Stonehenge, the Roman Baths at
					Bath, Buckingham Palace, and Westminster Abbey. This was a cool
					experience despite having to temporarily evacuate the hotel after
					arriving due toa bomb threat (!!!).</p>
					<p> In Paris, we got to visit historical sites such as the Louvre, the
						Eiffel Tower, and the Church of Notre Dame. In addition, we had the
						opporunity to visit the Palace at Versailles, which is by far the
						most beautiful building I have seen to this day. It is absolutely
						incredible. Our tour of the palace had us visit 20 rooms, or one
						percent of the entire palace, not including the gardens.
						As my friend said after an half hour of touring "No wonder the
						French rebelled."</p>
