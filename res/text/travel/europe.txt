I went to England and Paris over ten days with my mom and my best friends, mom,
grandmother, and brother. It was a really cool experience that I wouldn't trade
again for anything. In England, we had the opportunity to visit cool places such
as Stonehenge, the Roman Baths at Bath, Buckingham Palace, and Westminster Abbey.
This was a cool experience despite having to temporarily evacuate the hotel after
arriving due to a bomb threat (!!!).

In Paris, we got to visit historical sites such as the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower,
and the Church of Notre Dame. In addition, we had the opportunity to visit the
Palace at Versailles, which is by far the most beautiful building I have seen to
this day. It is absolutely incredible. Our tour of the palace had us visit 20
rooms, or one percent of the entire palace, not including the gardens. As my
friend said after an half hour of touring, "No wonder the French rebelled."
