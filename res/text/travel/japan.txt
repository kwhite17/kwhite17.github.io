For my self-graduation present, I decided to take a trip to Japan for two weeks.
It was an absolutely amazing trip. I primarily spent time in Tokyo and Kyoto.
However, I did spend a day in Nara to visit the Todaiji Temple (and two others who's names I forgot).

Kyoto was amazing. I think in my limited travel experiences it is safe to say
that I've never been to a city quite like Kyoto. The blend of temples, shrines,
and modern buildings created an experience that I believe I'll be extremely
challenged to find for a long time. One of my favorite discoveries was the
Maimai Cafe. It was a struggle remembering how to speak Japanese at an all
Japanese cafe, but because of my perseverance, I learned about this delicoius
Japanese dish called sukiyaki. The customer takes raw beef and barbecues in a
marinade with noodles and vegetables for a delicious stew-like experience. You can
also dip your food in raw egg for additional flavor.

Tokyo was also fantastic. It is unfathomable to think about how modern that
prefecture looks in comparison to the other places I've visited, including a
thriving Boston. Some of the highlights there were visiting the onsen and
visiting Tokyo proper, which contains both the imperial palace and the diet
building, encompassed in some of the shiniest skyscrapers I've seen in my life.
It was so breathtaking. There's so much more of Japan I could talk about
including the chaos at the Hachijo Crossing (this name could be wrong) at
Shibuya, anime nirvana at Akihabara, and the bullet train experience, but you
should just ask me if you know me.

One final point, please stop by Cafe Byron Bay in Asakusa, Tokyo. This is my
favorite bar in Japan. It's a cafe where local patrons come to speak English with tourists or
foreigners, giving you a great opportunity to learn a lot about Japanese culture
from the people who live there. The bartender/owner is really amazing and has
really created an awesome atmosphere.
