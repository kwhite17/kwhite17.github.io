      <img src="images/bigDub.jpg" alt="The man, the myth, the legend" />
      <p>Resident quirky nerd at your service! Hailing from Detroit, MI, I'm currently working as a software engineer at HubSpot in Cambridge, MA. I had the blessing of spending four fantastic years in the Boston area attending MIT. In
        my free time, I enjoy watching and playing sports, watching anime, coding, and spending some time in the Bible. My musical tastes primarily center around hip hop, R&amp;B, metal, and progressive rock.</p>
